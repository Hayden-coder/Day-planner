# Day-planner
<p>For this homework assignment we needed to make a day planner.The planner is setup so that past hours are grey, future hours are green, and the current hour is red. Items on the schedule can then be saved in local storage so that they can be referred to later. They can also be deleted.<p>

# Tools
<p>HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, moment.js<p>
